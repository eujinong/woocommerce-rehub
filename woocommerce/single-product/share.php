 * Single Product Share
 *
 * Sharing plugins can hook into here or you can add your own code directly.
 *
 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/woocommerce/single-product/share.php.
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion WooCommerce will need to update template files and you
 * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.
 *
 * @see 	    https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/template-structure/
